Retrospective - Sprint 3

Things that went well:
- Easy to add new endpoint
- UI clearly reflects new endpoints
- Easy to integrate existing services

Things that could have gone better:
- Write up from product missed details
    - POST should've been a GET
    - Health Assessment wasn't clear when trigger terms were between
- More testing data

Something I'd like to try to do differently:
- Implement using TDD to start
- More UI features added to app
