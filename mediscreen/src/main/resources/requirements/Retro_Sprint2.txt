Retrospective - Sprint 2

Things that went well:
Easy to implement notes feature following MVC
Implemented tickets to add notes for a patient

Things that could have gone better:
Writing unit tests before the code
More through explanation from Product Owner in email about what is required, tickets weren't clear
Sample commands changed port to 8082 from 8081 as specified in first sprint which was confusing
Create user stories before development

Something I'd like to try to do differently:
TDD
Enhance UI
