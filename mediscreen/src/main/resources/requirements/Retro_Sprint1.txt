Retrospective - Sprint 1

Things that went well:
Tickets provided clear tasks
Completed tickets without running into major issues
Created annotations to validate form

Things that could have gone better:
Missing ticket for environment set up
More resources in tickets regarding setting up docker
Created unit tests for newly implemented code

Something I'd like to try to do differently:
Try and do test driven development (TDD) in next sprint
Create feature branches and do code review before merging into main branch
Fill out API specification before implementation
