Implemented required REST endpoints following MVC design pattern (minus view).

data_file.json contains all info for people, fire stations, and medical records.
On application start-up, data is loaded into three maps for each data type (people, fire stations, medical records)
Map values are retrieved and updated based on purpose of each endpoint.
